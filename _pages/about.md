I'm a PhD student studying Cancer Cellular and Molecular Biology utilising in-vivo models. I have experience with Bioinformatics, particularly RNA-seq and Single-Cell RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and Microarrays.

I use machine learning and deep learning to obtain insights into data that can help fight disease, or bring company increased profit.

I use Python, R, Matlab, Julia and SQL.
